Hi there! I'm Katelyn. I'm beginning self study nearly a year (!) after graduating high school. 
My main focus is that of front-end web design, especially frameworks and libraries such as Sass, React, Bootstrap, and many others! 
I'm also intending - once I'm confident in my front-end capabilities - to dip my toes into PHP and SQL. 
I can be reached at katelyngrimoldby@gmail.com
